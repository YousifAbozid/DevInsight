## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v9.0.0 or higher) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1.22.0 or higher)
- Git

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YousifAbozid/DevInsight.git
   cd DevInsight
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your GitHub API credentials:

   ```
   VITE_GITHUB_API_KEY=your_github_personal_access_token
   ```

   > üí° **Note**: You can create a GitHub personal access token by following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:5173

### Available Scripts

- **`npm run dev`**: Start the development server
- **`npm run build`**: Type-check and build the app for production
- **`npm run preview`**: Preview the production build locally
- **`npm run lint`**: Check for code issues using ESLint
- **`npm run lint:fix`**: Automatically fix ESLint issues
- **`npm run format`**: Format all files with Prettier
- **`npm run format:check`**: Check if files are properly formatted
- **`npm run fix-all`**: Run both lint:fix and format to fix all issues

## üîê Authentication & Security

DevInsight uses GitHub's OAuth for authentication and secure API access.

### Authentication Flow

1. User initiates GitHub login
2. User authorizes DevInsight to access their GitHub data
3. GitHub redirects back to DevInsight with an authorization code
4. DevInsight exchanges the code for an access token
5. Access token is securely stored and used for API requests

### Token Storage

GitHub tokens are securely encrypted using crypto-js before being stored in browser storage.

## üì± Responsive Design

DevInsight is fully responsive and optimized for various screen sizes:

- **Desktop**: Full-featured dashboard with multi-column layout
- **Tablet**: Reorganized layout with preserved functionality
- **Mobile**: Streamlined interface with prioritized information

Responsive behavior is implemented using Tailwind CSS breakpoints and dynamic component rendering.

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

DevInsight employs several optimizations for smooth performance:

- **React Query Caching**: Minimize API calls with intelligent caching
- **Code Splitting**: Load components on-demand for faster initial loading
- **Memoization**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders with React.memo and useMemo
- **Virtualization**: Efficiently render large lists of repositories
- **API Rate Limiting**: Smart handling of GitHub API rate limits
